# Foreword

# Introduction

Introduction to the topic, what was researched and how the research was performed.

# Experiment

## Phases explanation

Some Phases can mix  together or be in a different order, but roadmapping and implementation always come last.

### **Understanding Microservices**

Some general explanation on microservices

General refactoring processes. (complete redo, partially, picking off parts, what is the aim)

### **Research**

This phase will be more about specific solution and technologies that are needed.

The steps of writing down what you need: 

- making criteria out of it
- looking for specific solutions
- comparing all the solutions
- thinking of the implementation and networking
- writing down the solution

Ask around, different people often know good options, the world is a wide place.

### **Testing**

Testing phase is also going to be during the research phase, since it could be considered research, to right before the roadmapping. Although testing and research have a certain overlap, during the research phase the point is to filter out the good solutions, which you can then extensively test in the testing phase. Sometimes you do need to do testing in order to be able to research to that is where the overlap lies.

### Roadmapping

The phase about making a roadmap for implementation.

Think about critical refactoring, what parts are priority

Think of priorities, what needs to be build first because it is a dependency of another service.

### Implementation

## Phases

Each phase will be explained in great detail with all the discoveries.

### **Understanding Microservices**

### **Research**

### **Testing**

### **Roadmapping**

### **Implementation**

## Notable Technologies
Some introductions and recommendations of certain technologies that can work with microservices
